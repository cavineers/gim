                <h3>Inspiration Leads To Innovation</h3>
                <h1>The Gears In Motion Initiative.</h1>
                <p>The GIM program (Gears In Motion) is a fun STEM activity geared towards elementary school students in order to teach the importance of working together like gears in a system. It centers around GIM, a gear-based toy that was designed,
                    CADed, and 3D printed by members of 4541. Gears In Motion starts with a short but informative presentation on gears, which leads to the activity. After watching a tutorial video, the students then work together as a team to piece together
                    the steps to the instructional booklet so that they can put together their GIMs as a team and learn to Turn Together... By the end of the program, the students involved will be able to take home their very own GIM.</p>
                <h1>Our Statement.</h1>
                <p>The GIM program believes in it's motto of, <i>"inspiration leads to innovation".</i> Engineers can only innovate in they are inspired to do so. Each person has an infinite amount of potential and what becomes of it relies completely on
                    how the person is inspired. Gears in Motion is a way to inspire the next generation of engineers to change the world through engineering. We try in any way we can to help young students understand the importance of engineering and
                    help them to see just how enjoyable it can be.</p>
