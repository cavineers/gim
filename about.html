                <h3>Inspiration Leads To Innovation</h3>
                <h1>The Gears In Motion Initiative.</h1>
                <p>The GIM program (Gears In Motion) is a fun STEM activity geared towards elementary school students in order to teach the importance of working together like gears in a system. It centers around GIM, a gear-based toy that was designed,
                    CADed, and 3D printed by members of 4541. Gears In Motion starts with a short but informative presentation on gears, which leads to the activity. After watching a tutorial video, the students then work together as a team to piece together
                    the steps to the instructional booklet so that they can put together their GIMs as a team and learn to Turn Together... By the end of the program, the students involved will be able to take home their very own GIM.</p>
                <h1>What Our Online Lessons Will Look Like.</h1>
                <p>During this Covid-19 Pandemic and beyond we will be offering GIM online to give you access to GIM anywhere. It is important to us that while we cannot meet in person we can still provide lessons to you so we can keep innovating together.
                    There online lessons will look a little different from in person lessons, but we hope you enjoy them just as much! On the homepage click the begin button to get to your portal. Once there start with activity 1 and work through each
                    of the activities till the end. Hit the "back to main page" button in the portal to go back to the activity list. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to us and we will help you through any problems. <a style="color: rgb(150, 148, 148)"
